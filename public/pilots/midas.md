**Axel Donovan** is a data destruction specialist and sole proprietor of **Moblin Solutions**. With a track record serving big-name clients like GMS, SSC, MSMC, and more, Moblin is who you call when you want a sensitive file gone - from everywhere - for good.

In his free time, Axel took up the name **Scrapper** and battled it out in the Gyre Demolition League, piloting his Hydra alongside his teammates Cargo and Polearm. However, one fateful match - a 3-on-3 tournament sponsored by Gamma Gum - saw him winning the "grand prize": a one-way trip to a garbage dump on Ngoc Linh Station, plus some bruises and minus any memory of what had happened to him. A series of accidents led to him joining up with fellow lancers Wither and Jade on their travels, but to what end, nobody can say...
