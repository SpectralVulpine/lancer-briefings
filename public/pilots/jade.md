**Laurelin Caspere** is a woman of many faces. Kidnapped by pirates at a young age, she was raised by her mentor Maroon to plunder merchant vessels and crack electronic systems. She was good at it, too. While her methods may seem unorthodox, none can deny that they are effective - sometimes, terrifyingly so. Just don't ask about the traffic cone incident.

For as long as she can remember, Laurelin has had exactly one goal in mind: find her lost brother **Basir**, if he still lives, and make sure he has the safe, stable life she could never enjoy. When she found him, however, she got far more than she bargained for.

As it turns out, Laurelin and Basir are two of many illicit clones of **Harrison II**. Their template: Juniper Vectis, a.k.a. Chrysalis, the supreme leader of the very pirate organization Laurelin belongs to. Laurelin's 'father', Jackson Caspere, cloned her and her many ill-fated siblings himself: Laurelin as "insurance", Basir and the others as human experiments. Their very existence poses a threat to Harrison Armory and Smith-Shimano Corpro, both of whom are keen to quietly silence them and ensure Harrison's bloodline remains unchallenged.

With the destruction of Project UPLIFT's four clones, Basir and Laurelin find themselves on the receiving end of Constellar Midnight's full attention. If Laurelin wants even a _shot_ at peace for herself and Basir, she will need to find a way to keep the Constellars and the Stewards' Council off her back.
