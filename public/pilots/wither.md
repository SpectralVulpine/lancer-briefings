Warrant Officer Wither is the founder and head of MSMC 316th Detachment "Merlin Group". Due to a mysterious memetic accident in his youth, his face looks like that of a man 50 years his senior, his hair bleached white by the shock and his voice reduced to a strained growl. As a result, he wears a prosocollar at all times to disguise his deformities.
An NHP specialist for as long as he can remember, Wither's journey truly began during a routine MSMC salvage operation. Amidst the vessel's wreckage and against all odds, he found a still-living NHP named Morrigan. Fascinated by the discovery, he quietly took her in, repairing her systems in secret. After years of working together and a harrowing encounter in Metavault-OUROBOROS, the two share an unbreakable bond.
Now, Wither and Morrigan work tirelessly to unravel the mechanisms behind NHP cascade, with the intention of building a new alternative to cycling: the **"Merlin Loop"**.
