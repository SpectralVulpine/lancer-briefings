# Mission // #003
## Charybdis

Neverlight has provided Wither and Jade with disguises: cleaning contractors from **Sherry's Cleaning and Homekeeping.** She's also contracted Moblin Solutions, Axel's company, with an impossible mission: delete all data Harrison Armory has on Chrysalis and the other illicit Harrison clones. While Wither and Jade infiltrate the facility on foot, Axel will be the "eye in the sky", providing electronic support from afar through a useful tool - a **dataspike.**

# Goals
- Locate and neutralize Dr. Killier.
- Delete all data pertaining to the illegal Harrison clones.
- Fake Jade's death.

# Stakes
- This area is among the highest-security facilities on Ras Shamra. Capture is a strong possibility.
- This is the best shot at wiping out knowledge of Chrysalis and her "family" for good. Another chance will not be forthcoming.

# Reserves
- **Access:** Neverlight has provided a "dataspike", which can be plugged into any terminal for Axel to access it remotely.
- **Access:** Jade and Wither have temporary-access ID cards that will get them into the Stenn estate - or part of it, anyway.
- **Decoy:** Jade has acquired a blueprint for a flash-cloned decoy body - perfect for faking one's death.
- **Distraction:** Some of Black Nebula's more unscrupulous members wait in the darkness for Jade's signal to raid Ras Shamran space.
