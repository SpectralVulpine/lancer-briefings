# Mission // #002
## West Wind

The intelligence gathered from the Heli-x guardsman points to an underground base on the daylit side of Ras Shamra. It is this facility that processes Project ZION's candidates before sending them off to the Nightside facility Polearm was found in.
The guardsman was bound to a blood contract and released in an effort to avoid arousing Killier's suspicions. If his plans remain unchanged, he will be visiting the location for an inspection **4.20.5024u**.

# Goals
- Raid the base for intelligence pertaining to Dr. Killier, Dr. Einsberg, and their goals.
- Locate and capture or neutralize Dr. Killier.

# Stakes
- Dr. Killier is a reclusive man. If he is not captured here, finding him will continue to be difficult.
- Heli-x has been using this facility to process prisoners before using them in experiments. It cannot be allowed to continue operation.

# Reserves
- **Access:** Axel has acquired system access to some of Heli-x's systems.
- **Decoy:** Jade has acquired a blueprint for a flash-cloned decoy body - perfect for faking one's death.
- **Distraction:** Some of Black Nebula's more unscrupulous members wait in the darkness for Jade's signal to raid Ras Shamran space.
- **Reinforcements:** Several Merlin Group operatives are available to reinforce Wither if needed.
