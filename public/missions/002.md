# Mission // #002
## Plowshare

Information points the party to **SHADE**, a Screamer in SYZYGY's former squad. Intelligence suggests she's undergone a similar procedure to the one that created SYZYGY, and that Heli-x is preparing to use her for their ultimate plan of destroying RA.

# Goals
- Locate SHADE.
- Capture or neutralize the target.

# Stakes
- SHADE represents a gross violation of the First Contact Accords. If she is left unchecked, she may pose an existential threat to Union and humanity at large.

# Reserves
- **Access:** Axel has acquired system access to some of Heli-x's systems.
- **Distraction:** Some of Black Nebula's more unscrupulous members wait in the darkness for Jade's signal to raid Ras Shamran space.
- **Reinforcements:** Several Merlin Group operatives are available to reinforce Wither if needed.
