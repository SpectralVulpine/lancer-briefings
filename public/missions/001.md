# Mission // #001
## Outrider

Overpower and Crossroads have uncovered intelligence pointing to a kidnapping operation at Bright Futures Inc. The perpetrator, Herbert Walfer, is responsible for selecting and "retrieving" an individual from the company for use in Heli-x's experiments. The crime is scheduled for 4.11.5024u - and the site has been set.
Team MAHK has an opportunity to get some answers. Interrupt the victim handover, and capture a Heli-x prisoner if possible.

# Goals
- Retrieve the kidnapping victim.
- Capture a Heli-x member alive for intelligence.

# Stakes
- This represents the party's best lead on the shady criminal group Heli-x. If they escape, picking up the trail again will be difficult.

# Reserves
- **Access:** Axel has acquired system access to some of Heli-x's systems.
- **Distraction:** Some of Black Nebula's more unscrupulous members wait in the darkness for Jade's signal to raid Ras Shamran space.
- **Reinforcements:** Several Merlin Group operatives are available to reinforce Wither if needed.
