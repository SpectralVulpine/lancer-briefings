**Team MAHK** prepares for an all-out assault on the recently-discovered Dayside Heli-x base. Their objective: locate and capture Dr. Killier if possible. Failing that, gather any intelligence they could find useful.

Despite a grueling, drawn-out assault on the Dayside base, Killier was nowhere to be seen. Not all was lost, however.
Ruin retrieved Dr. Caspere's reluctant flash-clone, who agreed to spill Killier's location in return for spilling the man's guts - and his own.

The party returned to Permafrosty to regroup and determine their next moves.
