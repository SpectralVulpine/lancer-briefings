# Ras Shamra // 4.05.5024u
After a grueling 29-hour procedure, **TEAM MAHK** has successfully freed **SYZYGY** from her shackles. After a chilling message from the Union Intelligence Bureau, the party returned to Permafrosty - only for Wither to learn some important intelligence from his Merlin Group operatives in the field.

Herbert Walfer, one of the interns at Bright Futures, Inc. has a mission - to locate and retrieve a suitable test subject for Heli-x's mission. The victim, a recent hire, has already been "acquired" - and the date is set for the handover to Heli-x's forces: **4.11.5024u.**

This poses an interesting opportunity for Team MAHK. If they set an ambush, they could apprehend one of Heli-x's people and press them for further answers. _Where is Dr. Killier? How is Dr. Einsberg involved? Where are these kidnapping victims being taken? How does Harrison Armory factor into all of this?_

However, all is not so simple. Overpower noticed a Mirage-class mech lurking around the site of the hand-off - and its sighting is a little _too_ perfect. Not only that, but recent happenings suggest this Mirage could be the very same **SHIFTER** from SYZYGY's old squadron.

Could the party be walking into a trap? Who will come out on top of this clash of gambits?
